# imStickered
Copied from webFromIM & reworked.

See the overall rationale in the [readme in the parent folder](../README.md).

This sample explores using [Snap's StickerKit][SK] as it allows for using Stickers without login. There will also be a sample exploring [LoginKit] and BitMoji. This simpler one seeks to show the ability to pull in stickers only in the iMessage app extension without worrying about deeplinking callback issues.

Note that this is a sample app under the MIT License (as per `../LICENSE`) so feel free to copy to build your own apps on top of the code here. I may have taken minor shortcuts or engineering approaches inadequate for production apps.
