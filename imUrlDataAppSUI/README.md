# imUrlDataAppSUI
See the overall rationale in the [readme in the parent folder](../README.md).

Same as imUrlDataApp but re-implemented in SwiftUI.

**	broken work in progress **

Currently a bit stalled working out the use of UIViewControllerRepresentable and it's a low-priority project so may not be updated for weeks.

## Architecture
The app side is a conventional SwiftUI app.

The iMessage extension uses embedding.
