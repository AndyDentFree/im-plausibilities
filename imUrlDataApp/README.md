# imUrlDataApp
See the overall rationale in the readme in the parent folder.

Same as imUrlData but adding a usable iOS App side rather than just appearing as an extension.

Note that we are not trying to share any significant logic between the two sides. One complicating factor is that MessagesViewController is a MSMessagesAppViewController.
