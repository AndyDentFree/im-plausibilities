# imUrlData
See the overall rationale in the readme in the parent folder.

This sample explores just using the [url][1] field of MSMessage to send data.

**Warning** this is limited to **5,000 characters**. Sending larger data is something ou have to manage separately with a cloud service.

## Project Structure

Created using XCode 10.1 as an iMessage App.
