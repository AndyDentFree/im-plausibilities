# imUrlData
See the overall rationale in the [readme in the parent folder](../README.md).

This sample explores just using the [url][1] field of MSMessage to send data.

**Warning** this field is limited to **5,000 characters**. Sending larger data is something you have to manage separately with a cloud service.

## Project Structure

Created using XCode 10.1 as an iMessage App.
