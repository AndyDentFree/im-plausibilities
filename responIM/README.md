# responIM
Copied from imUrlData

See the overall rationale in the [readme in the parent folder](../README.md).

This sample explores sending a **Reply** and using immediate send.

So you have one button active at a time - you are either sending the first message of a conversation or responding and seeing the response count go up.

Because it uses `MSConversation.send` your messages are sent immediately rather than appearing in a bubble where you can also add text (but have to remember to hit the send button).

## Project Structure

Created duplicating imUrlData and renaming everything
